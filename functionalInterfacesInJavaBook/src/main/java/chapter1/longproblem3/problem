A typical used car’s list value is its original price minus $1000 per
year since its manufacturing minus $500 for every 10,000 miles
driven. A used sports car’s list value adds back a $250 vintage
factor for every year since its manufacturing.
Write a functional interface named ListValue which computes
the list value for both typical cars and sports cars.
