Write a functional interface named ToString that is generic for
type T. Its functional method, named convert, converts a T to a
String.
Write two implementations of ToString:
– – l2s which converts a List<String> by creating a comma-
separated string
– – m2s which converts a Map<String,Integer> by creating a
comma-­separated field for each map entry with a colon
between the key and the value
Demonstrate the two implementations in a main program.
