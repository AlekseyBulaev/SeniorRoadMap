Problem Statement
The Playful Pets pet store wants a program to search for pets currently in the store. The
information stored for each pet is name, animal, breed, color, and price. When performing
a search, the program should list the first pet that matches the criterion and then list all the
pets that match the criterion. The most common search criteria are search by breed and
search by price. Use the program to search for poodles and to search for pets for $800 or less.
