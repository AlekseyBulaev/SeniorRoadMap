Write a functional interface named ListManipulator that is
generic for type T. Its functional method, named manipulate,
accepts a List<T> and a T as arguments and returns void.
ListManipulator has a default method named create that creates
an ArrayList<T>. The default method takes no arguments and
returns a List<T>.
Write three implementations of ListManipulator:
– – sListAdd which implements ListManipulator<String> and
whose functional method adds an element of type T to the end
of the list
– – iListAdd which implements ListManipulator<Integer> and
whose functional method adds an element of type T to the end
of the list
– – iListRmv which implements ListManipulator<Integer> and
whose functional method removes the first occurrence of an
element of type T from the list
Implementations iListAdd and iListRmv override default
method create with an implementation that sets the initial
ArrayList capacity to 50 elements.
Demonstrate the three implementations in a main program.
